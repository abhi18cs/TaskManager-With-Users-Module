#Title: TypeScript, MongoDB, Node.js, and Express CRUD API Project

Description:

Introducing a practical and efficient CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API project that harnesses the power of TypeScript, MongoDB, Node.js, and Express. This project comprises two core modules: the User Module and the Todo Module.

Key Features:

1. User Module:
   - User Management: The User Module offers robust capabilities for creating, reading, updating, and deleting user accounts.
   - User Authentication: A secure authentication system allows users to register and manage their accounts.
   - Profile Management: Users can update their profiles, change passwords, and modify their personal information.
   - User Roles: Define different user roles with customizable permissions for controlled access.

2. Todo Module:
   - To-Do List: The Todo Module enables the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of tasks, facilitating effective task management.
   - Task Prioritization: Tasks can be categorized and prioritized for efficient tracking.
   - Task Status: Keep track of task status with options such as 'To-Do,' 'In Progress,' and 'Completed.'
   - Notifications: Users can set notifications and reminders for upcoming tasks.

Project Highlights:

- TypeScript: Enjoy the benefits of TypeScript's strong typing system for error prevention and code maintainability.
- MongoDB: Utilize the flexibility and scalability of MongoDB to store user data and task information.
- Node.js: Develop an efficient server-side application capable of handling concurrent requests.
- Express: Create a performant and organized API using the Express.js framework with easy routing and middleware management.

This project is ideal for developers seeking a foundational CRUD API with user management and to-do list features. Whether you plan to extend this project or use it as a template for your own application, it provides a robust foundation for your development needs, with CRUD functionality for user accounts and task management.
